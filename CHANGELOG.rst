History of changes
==================


0.5.0 - 2019-06-27
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Dropped Python 2 support. If you need it, use the older versions.
- To reduce clutter in failing tests, notice `1070`_ is now silenced
  by default (unless you override ``HTTPOLICE_SILENCE``).

0.4.0 - 2018-03-31

0.3.0 - 2017-03-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For consistency, the backlog view now shows exchanges in direct order
  (that is, the latest exchange is now at the bottom).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added
-----
- The middleware is now compatible with new-style (Django 1.10+) ``MIDDLEWARE``
  as well as old-style ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``.
- You can now ask the middleware to raise ``ProtocolError``
  even on notices of severity "comment"
  by setting ``HTTPOLICE_RAISE = 'comment'``.

Deprecated
----------
- Setting ``HTTPOLICE_RAISE = True`` is deprecated
  in favor of the new form ``HTTPOLICE_RAISE = 'error'``.
  The next release will only support the new form.
